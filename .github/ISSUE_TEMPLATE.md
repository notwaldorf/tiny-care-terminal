Just as a sanity check, did you run `npm install -g git-standup`? A lot of the installation
problems we're seeing is because that step was skipped.

If you _did_ run it and you're still having problems, follow the template below to ensure a more accurate response to your issue.


- **Node Version**: `node --version`
- **tiny-core-terminal version**: `npm info tiny-care-terminal | grep version:`
- **Shell**: `bash, zsh, fish, something else?`
- **Terminal Program**: `tmux, iterm, terminator, cmd, something else?`
- **Operating System**: `Mac, Windows, Linux, BSD, Really, something else?`

Thank you!
